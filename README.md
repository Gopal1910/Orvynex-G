# Fashion Hub

A simple, responsive fashion e-commerce website built with HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

This project is a basic fashion website showcasing trendy outfits. It includes a header with navigation, a hero section, a featured products section, and a footer. The design is modern and responsive, using a pink color scheme to appeal to fashion enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using CSS media queries.
- **Header**: Includes a logo, navigation menu (Home, Shop, About, Contact), and a cart icon.
- **Hero Section**: Features a call-to-action with text and an image banner.
- **Products Section**: Displays featured products in a grid layout with images, titles, prices, and "Add to Cart" buttons.
- **Footer**: Simple copyright notice.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including Flexbox for layout, Grid for product cards, and transitions for hover effects.
- **Google Fonts**: 'Poppins' font for a modern look.
- **Pexels Images**: Free stock images for banners and products.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
- `style.css`: CSS file for all styling and responsive design.

## What Was Done

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Created a semantic HTML layout with header, sections, and footer.
   - Added navigation links and product cards.
   - Included external image links from Pexels.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Applied a reset for consistent styling.
   - Styled the header with a sticky position and pink background.
   - Designed the hero section with a gradient background and flex layout.
   - Created a responsive product grid using CSS Grid.
   - Added hover effects and transitions for interactivity.
   - Implemented media queries for mobile and tablet responsiveness.

3. **Responsiveness**:
   - Ensured the layout works on screens from 480px to 1024px and above.
   - Adjusted font sizes, padding, and layout directions for smaller screens.

## How to View

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No server setup is required as it's a static site.

## Future Enhancements

- Add JavaScript for interactive features like adding items to cart.
- Integrate with a backend for real e-commerce functionality.
- Add more pages (About, Contact, Product Details).
- Implement a search bar and filters.
